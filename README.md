# Cafe23 Management Website
I developed a Ruby-based web application for managing internal employee operations at a caf√©. The system was incrementally built in five phases, with a strong emphasis on following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure and ensuring robust security measures to grant appropriate access levels for different user types. To enhance data retrieval efficiency, I implemented APIs. 

### Wireframing/Prototyping
I also designed high fidelity wireframes to guide the development of future website dashboard actions and operations: [Interact with the wireframe prototypes on Figma.](https://www.figma.com/proto/pU85WsDiEDIEVQKJSuGpaW/67-272-Cafe23-%2F-Wireframes?type=design&node-id=48-519&scaling=scale-down&page-id=47%3A162&starting-point-node-id=48%3A519&show-proto-sidebar=1)

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the application using the rails server command (rails s) in your terminal.
3. Access the application by navigating to either [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) or [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
4. Feel free to log in with admin, manager, or employee permissions.
