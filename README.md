# Cafe23 Web Design & Development
Developed a Ruby-based web application to manage internal operations for a caf√©. Designed the application with a strong focus on MVC (model view controller) structure and security to ensure different types of users (admin, manager, and employee) had the appropriate level of access, and created APIs to enable the efficient retrieval of critical data.

### Wireframing
High fidelity wireframes were also designed to aid in the development of future website dashboard actions/operations: [Interact with the dashboards here.](https://www.figma.com/proto/pU85WsDiEDIEVQKJSuGpaW/67-272-Cafe23-%2F-Wireframes?type=design&node-id=48-24&scaling=scale-down&page-id=47%3A162&starting-point-node-id=48%3A519&show-proto-sidebar=1)
